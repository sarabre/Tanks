# Tanks
The Scriptable Object challenge from the tutorial is a game in which two tanks battle each other. The objective is for one tank to destroy the other. The game is designed to use Scriptable Objects, which are data containers that allow the game to store and retrieve information. The tutorial provides step-by-step instructions on how to create the game, including how to create the tanks, set up the environment, and program the tanks to interact with each other.
